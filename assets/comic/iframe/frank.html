            <h2>Progress Reports</h2>
            <h5>Report number 1</h5>
            <p>After discussing plans with my group, we discussed several characters we wanted to implement. After creating a list, we decided on some which we wanted to be considered main characters. I drew sketches of each of these main
                characters, which can be seen in the slides presentation we created. Some of these characters' designs are inspired by other characters, which I will outline now. The character Rick's design is based off the character Hajime Hinata
                from the video game Super Danganronpa 2: Goodby Despair. His design is based off the simplicity and plainness of Hajime's, but both still keep complex images on his clothing. The character design for Jerry is based off the
                protagonist of the video game Persona 3. I only really took the hair from this design, purely because I like the way it looks. Another design I used was that of Rhandall's, who is based off of Kamina from Gainax Studio's Gurren
                Lagann. The only part of this design I really used for Rhandall is the glasses and the hair, again because I like the aesthetic of it. The final design that derives from another is that of Andy, or "Tezuka." His design is a mix of
                two, those of Gundham Tanaka of Super Danganronpa 2: Goodby Despair and that of Kakashi Hatake from the manga series Naruto. The primary ideas I took from Kakashi's were his mask and gloves, which are both used to make him look like
                a ninja. From Gundham, I used a similar design which shows someone trying to look like a ninja but you can still tell that they are not one, as reflected by both of them wearing normal clothing underneath any gear they may be
                wearing. Veronica's design is completely original, and not inspired by any other characters I know of. </p>
            <h5>Report number 2</h5>
            <p>Over the past two weeks, a good amount has been done overall for the comic. I have delayed the drawing until after the winter holiday because I plan to get a new drawing tablet over that time, which will hopefully help me make better
                art. Fortunately, more work has been done by the other members of the group. Tate has helped me with writing and brainstorming on many occasions, along with what he has called "a lot of work" on the website we will be using in the
                future as a place to keep the comic. Alex has also been working, practicing the coloring and shading he will be doing on the final art on some early images I drew. </p>
            <h5>Report number 3</h5>
            <p>I have also been working hard, I decided that I was unhappy with the story which was written so far so I completely redid it, and am almost done with the rewrite. Once this is complete, we will have one chapter fully written and we
                plan to have six chapters in total. I have also been attempting to organize our storage of the information, as it was quite messy before. Still, this is not as important as the rest of the work which has been done by both myself and
                the other members of the group. </p>
            <h5>Report number 4</h5>
            <p> Over the break, I was able to do the line work for the first eight pages of the prologue of the comic. They are now accessible for the other members of my group, so I have no idea when it will be done. Based on how much is left in
                the script of the prologue, I estimate that I could be done with the line work of it fairly soon, hopefully before April. However, each page does take a while, so I need to leave a lot of time to do it, so I will try to work when I
                have the time to do so. So far, I am pretty satisfied with the pages so far, and I have included guidelines for my other group members to follow, such as lines for shading and boxes for text. </p>
            <h5>Report number 5</h5>
            <p> With the character designs mostly done, I am now doing official art of each character that we will be able to use in the future. It is not for the actual comic pages yet, but it will definitely be useful both for me to know what each
                character should look like and for my group to have them as reference. Because of time constraints, the only drawing I have been able to do as of late is the attached one, a character I created named Tezuka. While I still have a
                large amount of characters left to do this art of, I am looking forward to finishing it and getting the actual comic started. </p>
