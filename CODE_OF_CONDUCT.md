# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Foreword
Github told me to write this, I honestly don't care much what you do if I've
let you edit my site so long as it complies to my personal standards. I reserve
the right to remove you from the project at any point as well as remove or edit 
any contributions that I deem need editing or removal.

## Expectations
1. Don't be a dick.
2. Show some respect
3. Have fun

## That's all folks
