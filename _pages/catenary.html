<h1>Catenary Curve</h1>
<p>
    Catenary curves represent the shape formed by a chain of uniform density
    hanging from two end points. The equation is as follows:
</p>

\[y = a\cosh{\frac{x}{a}}\]

<p>
    Where a is defined as \(a = \frac{T_0}{\mu g}\). \(T_0\) is the tension at
    the bottom of the catenary, \(\mu\) is the linear density, and \(g\) is the
    acceleration due to gravity.
</p>
<p>
    But this is quite annoying. How am I supposed to know the precise tension at
    the bottom of the chain? That's what this web-applet is for. You provide
    end-points for the chain, a length for the chain, and a linear density, and
    I'll return the equation of the chain, including that pesky tension.
