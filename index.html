        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am a junior in college pursuing on a bachelor of arts in computer
            science and engineering physics with a minor in mathematics. I have
            done research at the undergraduate level, worked as a tutor in
            computer science and mathematics, as a lifegaurd, as a swim teacher,
            and as a water polo coach.</p>
        <p>I spent my summer working as a undergraduate research assistant in applied mathematics at Austin College.
            I am currently working with simulations of catenary curves. You can
            check out my progress <a href="https://github.com/MoonMoon2/Catenary-Problem">on my github</a>.</p>
        <p>I play NCAA water polo for <a href="https://austin.prestosports.com/sports/mwaterpolo/index">Austin College</a>.</p>
