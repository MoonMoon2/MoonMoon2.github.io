        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <hr>

        <p>I am a senior in college pursuing on a bachelor of arts in computer
            science and mathematics with a minor in engineering physics. I have
            done research at the undergraduate level, worked as a tutor in
            computer science and mathematics, as a lifegaurd, as a swim teacher,
            and as a water polo coach. I currently work as a full stack developer 
            developing tools for image processing and quality control.</p>

        <p>I just finished my career playing NCAA water polo for <a href="https://austin.prestosports.com/sports/mwaterpolo/2023-24/bios/ward_tobias_jtv6?view=profile">Austin College</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>My current personal project is learning APEX and the Salesforce platform.
