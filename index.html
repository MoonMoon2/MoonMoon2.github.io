        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <hr>

        <p>
            I am a newlygrad software engineer working for a small data company in Reston, VA. 
        </p>

        <p>I have done research at the undergraduate level, worked as a tutor in
            computer science and mathematics, as a lifeguard, as a swim teacher,
            and as a water polo coach. I currently work as a software engineer 
            developing web-apps for image ingestion and quality control, and now 
            designing and implementing data storage and retention policies.
        </p>

        <p>
            I just finished my career playing NCAA water polo for <a href="https://austin.prestosports.com/sports/mwaterpolo/2023-24/bios/ward_tobias_jtv6?view=profile">Austin College</a>.
        </p>

            My current personal project is an open-source web-based application for tracking volleyball stats. You can check that out over on my <a href="https://github.com/moonmoon2" target="_blank">github</a>
